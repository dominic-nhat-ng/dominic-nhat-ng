<h3><i>Good Quote</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<i>
“There are books so alive that you're always afraid that while you weren't reading, the book has gone and changed, has shifted like a river; while you went on living, it went on living too, and like a river moved on and moved away. No one has stepped twice into the same river. But did anyone ever step twice into the same book?” - Marina Tsvetaeva
