<h3><i>Good Quote</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<i>
“Even a person like this makes mistakes, can't always hold on to everything they'd like to,can't always force the world to spin in the direction of their choosing. You'll hug him longer than necessary and tell him to keep in touch. And you'll know, finally, that it had nothing to do with you.” - Sloane Crosley
