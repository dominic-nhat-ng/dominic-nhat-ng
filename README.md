<h3><i>Good Quote</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<i>
“He had no money and no home; he lived entirely on the road of the racing circuit, sleeping in empty stalls, carrying with him only a saddle, his rosary, and his books....The books were the closest thing he had to furniture, and he lived in them the way other men live in easy chairs.” - laura hillenbrand
