<h3><i>Good Quote</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<i>
<q>“I didn't go to bookshops to buy. That's a little bourgeois. I went because they were civilized places. It made me happy there were people who sat down and wrote and wrote and wrote and there were other people who devoted their lives to making those words into books. It was lovely. Like standing in the middle of civilization.”</q> - Jerry Pinto
