<h3><i>Good Quote</i></h3>

<blockquote>
<i>
“I put the books I was returning on the appropriate desk, and I began looking at the shelves of new arrivals. Most of them were some permutation on self-help. Going by how popular these books were and how often they were checked out, everyone in Bon Temps should have become perfect by now.” - Charlaine Harris
